Limit the number of posts that your authors can publish.

== Description ==

Limit the number of posts that authors can publish.  This is great for blog sites that have multiple authors but only want them to publish a limited number of posts.  This plugin supports custom user roles, and features post limitation by user role or individual user.  Also, all posts that are over the author's limit will be assigned to the post status "limited".  Admins can then access all limited posts through the "Limited" filter on the all posts screen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wpsite-limit-posts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
