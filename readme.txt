== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens when a user has exceeded his / her limit? =
Rather than force the user to delete their post, such posts will be submitted for review using a new post status labeled 'Limited.' An Admin can then determine if the post should be published. This ensures no author's work is disregarded simply because they exceeded their post limit.
